# Covid Case
## Overview
In this project users can visually see the statistics for corona virus for each country. Simple thresholds are used to determine the safety level of each country, displayed using a traffic light system (green, orange, red).
The website's business function is to sell facemasks and other corona virus-related products, such as hand sanitizers and visors.
The user has the ability to sign in and purchase these items.

## UX
The user design aims to create an application that is an intuitive shopping experience.
The web design links the need to purchase masks with the number of COVID-19 cases per country. The interactive map gives you more information about each country when you hover over it. There are a number of COVID-19 related products available to purchase underneath it. Hovering over the product will show you an alternative image of the product if there is one available.

The application navigation is very simple and easy to understand. The customer's decision making is simplified by using visual pictures of the products rather than lengthy descriptions. The customer does not need to have an account to view and purchase the products. The user can sign up at a later date and still see their order history from before they registered.

# Features
## Existing Functionality
### Nav Bar
* The nav bar is used to navigate throughout the website pages. There is different functionality depending on the user's access level.
* Before a user is logged in, they can navigate to the home page, can log in or sign up and can see their shopping basket.
* When a user is signed in, they can also reach their profile through "My Profile" and view their order history through "My Orders".
* When logged in as an admin, the user has additional privileges to add products.

### Home Page
* The home page contains the world map and the products users can buy.
* You can zoom in on the Highcharts world map to find the number of cases, deaths and number recovered for each country. You can also print or export the map in different formats. The countries are categorized green, orange or red depending on the thresholds.
* Underneath this is a gallery of the different products for sale, each containing a picture, description, price, quantity and buttons to interact with it. This also clearly shows if any products are out of stock.
* Users can choose "Add to Bag" to place the item in their checkout basket.
* Admins can also click "Update" to be taken to the "Update Product" page.

### Update Product - ADMIN
* An admin can update the product fields such as name, price, colour, number in stock etc.
* They can also delete products. This marks a product with a deleted status rather than actually deleting them as orders refer to products.  

### Add Products - ADMIN
* Admins can find the "Add Products" page in the nav bar.
* A user can add a product and define all of the attributes related to the product, which will then get added to the home page.
* They also can see a preview of the image(s) they uploaded.

### My Profile
* The user has the ability to view the current information associated with their profile.
* They can also edit this information here.
* The user can also reset their password from this page. They are sent a email which contain a reset password link.

### My Orders
* The user can see their full order history, and have the ability to reorder the items from this order (if the product(s) is still in stock).

### Sign up
* On this page the user can fill out the form to register an account with Covid-Case.

### Login
* The user can log into the account they have created.
* They can also reset their password here if they have forgotten it.

### View bag
* When the user clicks the little bag icon on the nav bar they will be taken to an overview of their shopping bag.
* They can increase and decrease the quantity of their products, and also remove them from the bag.
* The user can then continue to the checkout page.

### Checkout
* If the is logged in the form shall be pre-populated with the data from their profile. 
* The user can fill in / edit their details to let them buy their products. 
* It shows a list of items in the bag.

### Order Summary
1. After completing the order process, the user can see a summary page which shows the order ID and date, the delivery information and a table of the items ordered and the total.
2. There is also a home button and an Order History which navigate to the appropriate page.

## Database Schema
* Below you will find a picture of my database schema I could not get the exact SQL code ran by django to create this so I did it manually. The data types are not 100% accurate but it shows the table relationships and foreign keys.
<img src="/readmeimage/database_schema.png" alt="homepage-login-page"/>

## Future Enhancements
1. Search/filter functionality would be a good addition
2. Customer reviews
3. UI for the Admin to manage the fulfillment process by filling in the order date_dispatched when its shipped. The Django Admin UI can be used until this is added, so lower priority.
4. The application could be improved with Internationalization for displaying date, time and currency in a localised user format.
5. On the order history page I would like to make it so the order total date dispatched and place order again button all sit at the bottom of the card.
<img src="/readmeimage/orderhistory_styling.png" alt="orderhistory_styling" />

6. Add shipping options/charges.
7. Additional statistics and Covid trends could easily be added using the API and Highcharts/Highmaps or some other client side graphing library. 
8. Update the map to have a configurable time period such as last 7 days, last 30 days and all time.
9. Make the traffic light thresholds used for the map configurable in my settings.py file or in database.
10. Update the map tool tip to have thousand separator.

1. When i deployed the project to heroku i navigated to deployed url on my mobile and added the website as a app on my mobile. I checked that all pages where responsive on mobile and was a pleasant user experience. :heavy_check_mark:
2. I used chrome dev tools mobile view to check across different mobile devices but i found out this isn't always accurate. The dev tools showed some pages not being responsive yet on my mobile it looked okay. :heavy_check_mark:
3. When i was first checking out how it looked on mobile i realised that the user couldn't see there shopping bag unless they clicked the hamburger menu. So i took the shopping bag out of the hamburger menus and just displayed it on the navbar.

### Known Issues :small_red_triangle:
1. On the password reset done page there is a pop up that is being displayed by the messages framework that should be removed. :x:
2. In my database model i have the price set to the products price so if the price of a product changes then the orders price will to. To fix this I could copy the price to the OrderItem when the order is placed. An alternative may be to have an effective date on the price so that we can have the price history in the product by using something like a ProductPrice table with columns: ProductID, EffectiveStartDT, EffectiveEndDT, ProductPrice.


## Deployment
#### To deploy the project to Github the following steps were taken:
<!-- todo -->
1. Created a master branch in Github repository
2. Committed files to the staging area using bash terminal commands: git status; git add (specify directory); git commit -m"add message"
3. Pushed files to the working environment using git push, which then updates the repository.
4. Published site from master branch using settings tab in the main page of the repository, select source as master branch, then save
5. git push -u origin master


#### Environment variables:
1. I created a file named env.py in root of your project. I used this file to define the environment variables
2. I created a file name .gitignore added env.py to this file so that it got excluded from github.
3. In my  env.py file I needed to import os.
4. To assign my environment variables its as simple as doing the following:
```python
    import os
    os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here"
```
5. Then we need to import the env file we do this by importing os.path then checking if "./covid_case/env.py" exists if it does import it. Like in the following example:
```python
    import os.path
    if os.path.exists("./covid_case/env.py"):
        from . import env
```
#### Deploying to heroku:
1. I started by creating an account at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/)
2. Then I created a package dependency file called requirements.txt by running the command "pip freeze > requirements.txt". This needs to be called requirements.txt and has to be in the root of the project for heroku to install the packages listed in the file.
3. I created a new app by navigating to dashboard.heroku.com/apps then clicking the new button.
4. Then I logged into the heroku CLI by typing heroku login into my terminal.
5. In order to  get the application up and running i had to create a Procfile. The Profile tells Heroku which file is the entry point. A Procfile looks something like this "web: gunicorn covid_case.wsgi" (process type: command).
6. To connect an existing repository from Github to Heroku use the following CLI syntax "heroku git:remote -a (followed by name of Heroku app)"
7. To push to Heroku Master Branch, then simply use "git push heroku master"
8. In order for our application to run on heroku we need to specify a few Config Vars in Heroku. To do this go to Settings tab > Config Variables followed by the various config variable needed.
9. I needed to add the following lines to my settings.py in order to tell heroku what database to access
```python
    import dj_database_url
    
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
    # Update the SQL database to the database in the heroku environment
    db_from_env = dj_database_url.config(conn_max_age=600)
    DATABASES['default'].update(db_from_env)
```
10. I used Django-heroku in order to configure DATABASE_URL , ALLOWED_HOSTS, WhiteNoise (for static assets), Logging, and Heroku CI for my application. This was done as follows.
```python
    import django_heroku
    django_heroku.settings(locals())
```

#### Deploying files to AWS
