# Covid Case
## Overview
In this project users can visually see the statistics for corona virus for each country. Simple thresholds are used to determine the safety level of each country, displayed using a traffic light system (green, orange, red).
The website's business function is to sell facemasks and other corona virus-related products, such as hand sanitizers and visors.
The user has the ability to sign in and purchase these items.

## UX
The user design aims to create an application that is an intuitive shopping experience.
The web design links the need to purchase masks with the number of COVID-19 cases per country. The interactive map gives you more information about each country when you hover over it. There are a number of COVID-19 related products available to purchase underneath it. Hovering over the product will show you an alternative image of the product if there is one available.

The application navigation is very simple and easy to understand. The customer's decision making is simplified by using visual pictures of the products rather than lengthy descriptions. The customer does not need to have an account to view and purchase the products. The user can sign up at a later date and still see their order history from before they registered.

# Features

## Testing














1. I used Chrome Dev Tools for debug Testing. !!REVIEW
i. I used the inspect feature to check different elements on my page.
ii. I used the coverage tab to check my css was being used on the given page.
iii. I used the network tab to see what was taking a long time to load and what wasn't loading.
iv. I used the computed tab to see the final state of a given element.
v. I used the device toolbar to check that my website was rendered in a responsive manner on all device's.
vi. I installed the chrome Lighthouse plugin to use the audit feature to check Performance, progressive web app, Best practices, accessibility and SEO.
2. Application Testing !!CHANGE
i. I tested that everything worked okay when resizing the browser.
ii. I ran all my tests on localhost (root website) then pushed it onto github (where ran off the subdomain). Checked that all resources loaded properly off the root and subdomain.
iii. I checked on mobile to see that everything was working correctly.
iv. I ran into some problems trying to get blueprints to work and i solved this problem by changing how I initialised my DB.
v. I ran into some problems with basic html i solved them by googling.
## Deployment
#### To deploy the project to Github the following steps were taken:
1. created a master branch in Github repository
2. Committed files to the staging area using bash terminal commands: git status; git add (specify directory); git commit -m"add message"
3. Pushed files to the working environment using git push, which then updates the repository.
4. Published site from master branch using settings tab in the main page of the repository, select source as master branch, then save
5. The repository can be cloned by clicking Clone or Download on the main page of the repository
6. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click the clipboard icon to copy the clone URL for the repository
7. Open Git Bash Terminal
8. Type git clone, and then paste the URL, Press Enter. A local clone will be created.
9. 

#### Environment variables:
1. create a file named env.py in root of your project. use this file to define you environment variables
2. create a file name .gitignore add env.py to this file
3. in your env file we need to import os.
4. To assign your environment variables is easy its as simple as doing the following:
```python
    import os
    os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here"
```
5. Then we need to import the env file we do this by importing os.path then checking if "./covid_case/env.py" exists if it dose import it. Like in the following example:
```python
    import os.path
    if os.path.exists("./covid_case/env.py"):
        from . import env
```
#### Deploying to heroku:
1. I started by creating an account at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/)
2. Then I created a package dependency file called requirements.txt by running the command "pip freeze > requirements.txt". This needs to be called requirements.txt and has to be in the root of the project for heroku to install the packages listed in the file.
3. I created a new app by navigating to dashboard.heroku.com/apps then clicking the new button.
4. Then I logged into the heroku CLI by typing heroku login into my terminal.
5. In order to  get the application up and running i had to create a Procfile. The Profile tells Heroku which file is the entry point. A Procfile looks something like this "web: gunicorn covid_case.wsgi" (process type: command).
6. To connect an existing repository from Github to Heroku use the following CLI syntax "heroku git:remote -a (followed by name of Heroku app)"
7. To push to Heroku Master Branch, then simply use "git push heroku master"
8. In order for our application to run on heroku we need to specify a few Config Vars in Heroku. To do this go to Settings tab > Config Variables followed by the various config variable needed.
9. I needed to add the following lines to my settings.py in order to tell heroku what database to access
```python
    import dj_database_url

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }

    db_from_env = dj_database_url.config(conn_max_age=600)
    DATABASES['default'].update(db_from_env)
```
10. I used Django-heroku in order to configure DATABASE_URL , ALLOWED_HOSTS, WhiteNoise (for static assets), Logging, and Heroku CI for my application. This was done as follows.
```python
    import django_heroku
    django_heroku.settings(locals())
```
