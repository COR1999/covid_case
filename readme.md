# Covid Case
## Overview
In this project I have planned that users can visually see the statistics for corona virus for each country. A simple threshold is used to identify which countries are on the green list.
The business part of the website is to sell facemasks and other corona virus related products such as hand sanitizers and visors.
The user has the ability to sign in and purchase.

## UX
In my user design I wish to create a application that is an intuitive shopping experience. The application navigation is very simple and easy to understand.
I selected products that minimized consumer decision making by using visual pictures of the products rather than lengthy descriptions.
