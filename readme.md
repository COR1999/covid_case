# Covid Case
## Overview
In this project users can visually see the statistics for coronavirus for each country. Simple thresholds are used to determine the safety level of each country, displayed using a traffic light system (green, orange, red).
The website's business function is to sell facemasks and other coronavirus-related products, such as hand sanitizers and visors.
The user has the ability to sign in and purchase these items.

## UX
The user design aims to create an application that is an intuitive shopping experience.
The web design links the need to purchase masks with the number of COVID-19 cases per country. The interactive map gives you more information about each country when you hover over it and there are a number of related items available to purchase underneath it. Hovering over the product will give you another view of the item.

The application navigation is very simple and easy to understand. The consumer decision making is simplified by using visual pictures of the products rather than lengthy descriptions. The customer does not need to have an account to view and purchase the products. If they don't already have an account when they place an order, they can sign up at a later date and still see their order history.

## Deployment
#### To deploy the project to Github the following steps were taken:
1. created a master branch in Github repository
2. Committed files to the staging area using bash terminal commands: git status; git add (specify directory); git commit -m"add message"
3. Pushed files to the working environment using git push, which then updates the repository.
4. Published site from master branch using settings tab in the main page of the repository, select source as master branch, then save
5. The repository can be cloned by clicking Clone or Download on the main page of the repository
6. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click the clipboard icon to copy the clone URL for the repository
7. Open Git Bash Terminal
8. Type git clone, and then paste the URL

#### Env variables:
1. create a file named env.py in root of your project. use this file to define you environment variables
